# RezSwap
### To Install, download the "RezSwap Install" - RezSwapSetup.exe from the Releases section on this page.

I often find myself needing to switch resolutions before doing screenshares - and hate having to go into Display Settings each time to do it. So I wrote this little utility that runs as a tray/notification area icon and allows you to quickly switch between your favorite screen resolutions.

In the settings: 
- You can choose from all of your system's available resolutions - and just check the ones that you want available from the menu.
- Enable starting the app automatically with Windows
- Change the confirmation setting
- ...and that's all! nothing fancy but it does what it needs to.
