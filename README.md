# RezSwap
### To Install, download the "RezSwap Install" - RezSwapSetup.exe from the Release section on this page.

I find myself needing to switch resolutions before doing screenshares - and hate having to go into Display Settings each time to do it. So I wrote this little utility that runs as a tray/notification area icon and allows you to quickly switch between your favorite screen resolutions.
